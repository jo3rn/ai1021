## official module description

[AI1021 Bachelor-Projekt Angewandte Informatik](https://www.hs-fulda.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Unsere_Hochschule/Hochschulrecht/Pruefungsordnungen/Angewandte_Informatik/BSc_AI_2017_Ae2021.pdf#page=42) (German)

Students can work on a comprehensive task from the field of "Applied Computer Science" in a team and are able to organize their work independently in the form of a project. Students have knowledge of project work and project management and are able to implement their previous subject-specific knowledge in an application project. For the elaboration of the project, students should refer to and evaluate scientific literature in order to become familiar with scientific-systematic working techniques for the processing of problems. Finally, students apply the lecture and presentation techniques they have learned and present their project results. Through the mutual evaluation of the projects (peer review), students have the ability to contribute to the scientific discussion of a presentation.

Students work on a project with a focus on "Applied Computer Science", the content of which is chosen in such a way that the teaching content of the individual modules of the degree program is incorporated, further deepened and placed in a larger context. The content is deepened, for example, on the basis of the specialization from the fourth semester onwards. Students are given the opportunity to develop a practical technical solution and implement it independently. For example, they design and implement a comprehensive software application according to a given set of requirements. In doing so, they practise the difficult collaboration in larger development teams.

They use the previously acquired specialist knowledge from the "Software Development" and "Computer Systems and Networks" sections of the curriculum and actively apply project management methods and soft skills. Project management is taught as an introduction:

- Conceptual basics of project management
- Project phases
- Planning
- Controlling
- Monitoring
- Project organization (internal and external)
- Leading of projects
- Agile and classic project management tools

In the seminar part of the module, students are supported in the use of scientific literature and the application of scientific methods as part of their project. For the completion of the project, students prepare a paper using scientific and methodological working techniques. This prepares them for the independent preparation of a scientific paper.
