## Tasks

- visit any public git repository (e.g. on [GitHub](https://github.com/explore) or [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/explore/repos)). Open the git log. Read through the commit messages. Try to understand what happened. Is it easy? Is it plausible?

For each of the 2 following problems:
- create a new Git repository
- only one file is allowed in the repository
- create a solution for the leetcode problem
- everybody needs to commit at least once

Problems:
1. [Calculator with method chaining](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculator-with-method-chaining/description/)
2. [Older Than Me](https://edabit.com/challenge/iwdZiFucR5wkQsFHu)
