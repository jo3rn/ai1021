# Week 07 - Coding together

[Acceptance Criteria](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/project-management/acceptance-criteria)

[Definition of Done](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-definition-done)

## Tasks

- (15 min) **Acceptance Criteria**

    - Inspect the boards of the other teams. Pick out one card/task and think about an acceptance criteria for it.

- (30 min) **Definition of Done**

    - Brainstorm within the team: What does "done" mean for you? Think about aspects such as code quality, documentation, version control, testing and deployment.
    - Create a brief checklist based on your findings.
    - Document your "Definition of Done" in your `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

- (30 min) **Style Guide**

    - Look for a style guide for the programming languages you use, examples:

        - Python: [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
        - JavaScript: [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)
        - Kotlin: [Coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html)

    - Apply style rules automatically using a linter (e.g. via command or IDE integration), examples:

        - Python: [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) or [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/)
        - JavaScript: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) or [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
        - Kotlin: [Ktlint](https://pinterest.github.io/ktlint)
        - more examples: [super-linter](https://github.com/super-linter/super-linter)

    - Add your approach to `CONTRIBUTING.md` so others can reproduce it.

## Checks for Understanding

What is the difference between a "Definition of Done" and a "Definition of Ready"?
