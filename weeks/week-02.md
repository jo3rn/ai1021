# Week 02 - Ideation and Planning

## Project ideas

- a game for the [Playdate](https://play.date/dev/) handheld game system
- a [JavaScript game with maximum 13kb](https://js13kgames.com/)
- QR Code generator ([learn a bit about QR codes here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5ebcowAJD8))
- analysis/visualization of open data, e.g. using [GovData](https://www.govdata.de/), [Open Food Facts](https://openfoodfacts.org/) or [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org)
- a planner for scheduling duties for clubs (e.g. soccer clubs)
- vocabulary training (this is how [babbel](https://www.babbel.com/) started)

## Tasks

You can use the voting tool [Planning Poker Online](https://planningpokeronline.com/) to decide on some of the points below.

- collectively decide on an idea for your project
- each individually, think about 3 features (10 minutes)
    - take a sheet of paper, write down a few notes or sketch them out
- brainstorm to collect features
- prioritize features
    - what are core functionalities, what is "nice to have"
    - in what order will they be implemented
    - what is dependent on each other
- create wireframes of the essential screens and user flowcharts, e.g. via tools such as
    - [draw.io](https://draw.io)
    - [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
    - or drawn by hand
- decide on a Kanban board to use, e.g. [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/features/issues)
    - decide on a column layout (e.g. "ToDo", "In Progress", "Code Review", "QA", "Done")
    - write [User Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story)
    - write [Acceptance Criteria](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/project-management/acceptance-criteria) 
    - write tasks to accomplish the User Stories

## Checks for Understanding

- How does a Kanban board help in managing a software project?
- What is the purpose of cards & columns?
- What is a 'Work In Progress' limit and why can it be beneficial?
