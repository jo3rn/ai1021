- **Objective**

    - argue against the use of the goto statement in programming
    - promote structured programming as a better alternative
    
- **Hypothesis**
    
    - goto statements lead to code that is difficult to read and error-prone
    - structured programming improves code clarity, maintainability, and correctness
    
- **Research Method**

    - logical reasoning
    - theoretical analysis
    - empirical observations from people's experiences

- **Reasoning**

    - Goto statements create complex and unstructured control flows, making programs harder to understand and maintain.
    - control structures like loops and conditionals, lead to clearer and more reliable code.

- **Result**

    - argument against the use of goto statements, which influenced the programming community to instead adopt structured programming practices in modern programming languages
