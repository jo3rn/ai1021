## Tasks

- (30 min) Review

    - Silently read the `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` of another group. Take notes on anything remarkable.
    - Discuss with your group. Gather 2 great aspects and 2 ideas for improvement.
    - Present your findings to the whole classroom.

- (45 min) Mini Retro

    - Take 2 small pieces of paper. On your own, write about your team collaboration experience so far (one sentence each):

        1. what you have liked
        2. what could be improved
    
    - We collect the scraps of paper and anonymously discuss them in class.

## Checks for Understanding

Read the Agile Manifesto. For each line in the manifesto, think of 2 concrete situations in which:

 1. the item on the left should be valued more than the item on the right.
 2. the item on the right is valuable.
