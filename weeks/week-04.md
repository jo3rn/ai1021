# Week 04 - Architecture

some basic concepts:

- [Separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)
- [Encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming))
- [Modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity)
- [Fault tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_fault_tolerance)
- Security (dedicated topic of another week)
- [Maintainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintainability)
- [Scalability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability)
- [Performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_performance_testing)
- Flexibility, e.g. via [configuration files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_file) or [Feature toggles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle)

## Tasks

- in groups of 3:

    - (5 min) choose one design pattern
        - [Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)
        - [WebApp Patterns](https://www.patterns.dev/)
    - (20 min) discuss the pattern in the group
    - (3 min) explain the pattern to the class using an example

- in your software team:

    - (5 min) choose one of the software architecture styles

        - [Model–view–controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
        - [Client-server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model)
        - [Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)
        - [Monolith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application)
        - [Event-driven architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture)
        - [Layered Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture)

    - (20 min) discuss it in the group
    - (3 min) explain the style to the class
    - (25 min) Create a high-level diagram of your (desired) software architecture. Possible tools:

        - [draw.io](https://draw.io)
        - [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) (leverages version control), try it out in [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live) 

    - add the diagram to a Git repository

## Checks for Understanding

1. Browse a well-documented open source project, e.g. on [GitHub](https://github.com/explore) or [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/explore/repos)
1. Identify the main components / modules. What are their responsibilities?
1. Can you spot design patterns?
1. How would a diagram of that project look like?
