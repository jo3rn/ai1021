## Tasks

- Collect within the team:

    1. software products
    2. non-software products

  which you find particularly successful or horrible in terms of design?

    - (10 min) Find a total of 4 examples (1 for each category and extreme), e.g. image, video, live walk through. [Here's one to get you started](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juicero).
    - What properties make these examples successful or horrible?
    - (4 min) Present your findings to the rest of the class.

- (5 min) Show and describe your wireframes from the last week to the class.

## Checks for Understanding

Just a few memes today:

![Comic with 2 pictures. The first picture shows two adults standing next to a crib. A child is lying in the crib under 4 animal figures that are turning and playing music. The second picture shows the perspective of the child, who can only see the rear parts of the animal figures.](/img/clients_vs_users_perspective.jpeg)

![Two photos. The first photo shows a cute-looking mug in the shape of a cat. The cat's ears protrude beyond the usual rim. The second photo shows a person drinking from the mug. The protruding ears poke into the person's eyes.](/img/ui_ux.jpeg)
