## Bug Bounty

Let another group run and use your software. Likewise, you do the same with another group's software.

Try to provoke a bug, e.g. with unexpected user behavior.

Create a bug report:

- concise title
- description of:
    - actual behavior
    - expected behavior
- steps to reproduce the bug
- useful information on environment (operating system, device, software version,...)
- visual evidence (screenshot, video,...)
- logs
- any other relevant information

## Tasks

- (15 min) Fix the reported bug.

    - If that's not possible within the time frame: mitigate the effects of the bug.

- (10 min) Writes tests that check the absence of the bug.

    - If that's not possible: can the system be changed to allow testing for this bug?
