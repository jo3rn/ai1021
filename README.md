## Description

This is AI1021, University of Fulda's introduction to project work in the realm of software development. This course teaches you how to work effectively with others to build awesome software. It's less about good individual coding skills and more about leveraging teamwork to achieve greater results than you would be able to on your own. This involves division of labor, coordination, discussing ideas, resolving conflicts and celebrating successes. We will examine how to get the software to users and which measures are recommended for a long-lasting project. There will also be a segment on the scientific method that shows you how to study and evaluate scientific sources to become an even more rational thinker.

<a id="toc-time-location"></a>

## Time & Location

This course ordinarily meets for a lecture and discussion session on campus on Tuesdays, 3:30pm–6:45pm. The room is specified in horstl. Students are expected to attend these meetings in person. A connection from remote locations is not supported.

<a id="toc-grades"></a>

## Grades

This is a pass/fail course without grades.

You are expected to

- attend the weekly meetings
- present a (self-chosen) scientific paper on a computer science topic
- work regularly together as a team on a final project:
   - initial idea pitch
   - weekly updates
   - one retrospective
   - presentation of the project in the last session

You must meet all expectations in order to be eligible for a satisfactory grade unless granted a compensation for disadvantages in examination performance ("Nachteilsausgleich") by the examination board ("Prüfungsausschuss").

Final grades are determined using the following weights:

|                               |     |
| ----------------------------- | --- |
| final project                 | 60% |
| scientific paper presentation | 20% |
| (active) attendance           | 20% |

The basis for evaluation:

- all "visible" artifacts (e.g. commits, pull requests, code reviews, user stories, mockups, documentation and whatever can be put in a zip archive)
- participation during meetings (e.g. small presentations, discussions, questions and whatever can be considered an ephemeral moment of light)

<a id="toc-books"></a>

## Books

No books are required. You can ask for recommendations on specific topics though. Some books are referenced on the week's page.

<a id="toc-office-hours"></a>

## Office Hours

There are no office hours. The weekly appointments offer sufficient time and are the best opportunity to seek help or ask questions.

You have the option of sending me an email. However, I do not answer them every day.

<a id="toc-checks-for-understanding"></a>

## Checks for Understanding

Checks for understanding are short assignments after each meeting to practice applying each week's concepts.

These checks are *optional*, but pay into your active participation if you present them in the following week. So they could also be called opportunities to shine.

<a id="toc-student-conference"></a>

## Student conference

The **Student Conference** is an epic event during which we dive into your choices of scientific papers. Everyone presents insights from the world of science and everyone learns something new.

Make your presentation appealing, engaging and informative so that we all benefit from it.

| Milestone      | allotted time | Date                   |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Presentation   | 10 min (max!) | Week 08 and Week 09    |

<a id="toc-final-project"></a>

## Final Project

The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is your opportunity to showcase your graduation progress and develop your very own piece of software. So long as the project draws upon your degree’s learning objectives, the nature of your project is entirely up to you (albeit subject to my approval).

You may implement your project in almost any language(s). You are welcome to utilize any infrastructure, provided you grant me access to any hardware and software that your project requires. Deviations from this rule must be well justified (e.g. the hardware cannot be transported or removed).

You may build something of interest to you: solve an actual problem, impact campus, or change the world. Strive to create something that outlives this course.

You are required to collaborate in a group of **4-6** classmates. Needless to say, it is expected that all students contribute equally to the design and implementation of the group’s project. Moreover, it is expected that the project’s scope is appropriate to the group’s size.

You are welcome to solicit advice from others outside your group, so long as you respect the course’s policy on academic honesty.

During the **Final Project Presentation** (Release) you demo your project. Each member of the group is responsible for a part of the presentation.

| Milestone      | allotted time | Date                   |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Proposal       | 10 min        | Week 03 (2024-11-12)   |
| Status Report  | up to 10 min  | every week from now on |
| Retrospective  | 30-45 min     | Week 11 (2025-01-14)   |
| Release        | 30 min        | Week 15 (2025-02-11)   |

<a id="toc-attendance"></a>

## Attendance

Attendance at the fixed events (as outlined in the sections *Student Conference* & *Final Project*) is **mandatory**. Exceptions will only be considered on submission of a medical certificate ("Krankmeldung"). If this is missing, the respective event will be assessed as failed. Any missed event must be compensated for in an appropriate way as soon as possible.

The only exceptions are the weekly team updates. For this it is only necessary that **at least 2** team members are always present. If an update does not take place, this will have a negative effect on the entire team.

<a id="toc-academic-honesty"></a>

## Academic Honesty

The course’s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as “be reasonable.” The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.

The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on tasks is permitted to the extent that you may ask others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you.

Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that I consider reasonable and not reasonable. Acts considered not reasonable are handled harshly. That may include an unsatisfactory or failing grade for work submitted or for the course itself.

<a id="toc-honesty-reasonable"></a>

### Reasonable

- discussing the course’s material with others in order to understand it better
- helping a classmate identify a bug in their code
- viewing, compiling, or running a classmate’s code
- writing code together if all authors are comprehensibly documented (e.g. individual commits or co-authored commits)
- incorporating a few lines of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that you cite the lines’ origins
- submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted previously to another course, so long as you disclose the extent in your submission
- turning to the instructor for help
- turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course’s own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties
- working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you

<a id="toc-honesty-not-reasonable"></a>

### Not Reasonable

- accessing or attempting to access, without permission, an account not your own
- failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course’s own lessons and integrate into your own work
- paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own
- submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond the few lines allowed herein
- submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another course
- using AI-based software (e.g. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, et al.) that suggests or completes answers to tasks or lines of code

We have a lot of references to external resources. Unfortunately, servers are not immortal and sometimes _the Internet_ very well does forget. In that case, try to paste the link into the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/) or some other archive of your choice.
